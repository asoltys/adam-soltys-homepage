<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>
I'm 26 years old, currently living in Vancouver, British Columbia.  I work for the Canadian federal government building intranet web applications.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Interests</h2>

<p>
In the summertime I like to ride my bicycle, hike, camp, play tennis, swim, travel, and lounge out in the sun.  In the winters I spend more time watching movies and reading books, blogs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> articles.
</p>

<p>
  My taste in music is pretty diverse. I'll enjoy just about anything depending on my mood.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Philosophy</h2>

<p>
I'm an optimist.  The more I learn and discover what's already been accomplished, the more I appreciate the magnitude of human achievement and potential.  You'd be hard-pressed to find something that I would consider uninteresting.</p>

<p>I try to lead a relatively simple, low-impact lifestyle.</p>
