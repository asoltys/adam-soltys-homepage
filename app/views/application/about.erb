<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>
I was born in Vancouver in 1983 but I did most of my growing up in the suburbs of Richmond, BC.  I recently moved to Edmonton to be with my girlfriend Chelsea who is doing a two-year medical residency program at the University of Alberta.  I graduated from <a href="http://ubc.ca/" title="University of British Columbia">UBC</a> at the end of 2006 with a degree in computer science.  Now I'm working full-time for <a href="http://www.pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca" title="Public Works and Government Services Canada"> Public Works and Government Services Canada</a> where I build web applications for government employees.

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>
I've had a pretty keen interest in computers and the Internet for about as long as I can remember.  I also enjoy learning about history, philosophy, religion and languages.  I've taken courses in Japanese, German, French, and Spanish but haven't managed to retain much of any of them.  I like to stay active by riding my bike, jogging, playing tennis and swimming laps.  In the summers I go on weekend camping trips with friends and spend a lot of time at the beach.  When the weather's not so nice, I'll curl up with a good book or spend my time watching movies or surfing the Internet.  I typically do some hiking every summer and some snowboarding every winter too, which gets me out into the great outdoors.
