    <h1>Adam Soltys</h1>
    <h2>Open source software developer</h2>

    <p>I made a bitcoin wallet app, <a href="https://coinos.io/">coinos</a>, and still work on it from time to time</p>
    <p>I worked on <a href="https://althea.net/">Althea</a> in 2018 and 2019 and hope to establish a community network in my neighbourhood at some point</p>
    <p>I'm a member of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/dctrlvan/">Decentral Vancouver</a> and sometimes give talks and attend events there</p>
    <p>I like gardening and for a short while I was a <a href="https://yummyyards.ca">farmer</a>. You can see my other jobs on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-soltys-891b5520/">LinkedIn</a></p>
    <p>Politically, I'm an anarcho-capitalist voluntaryist. I was born and raised in so-called Canada. I pay Canadian taxes and abide by Canadian law for the most part but only under duress, to avoid fines, imprisonment, and marital strife. I reside in territory that Canada lays claim to but that was unceded by the indigenous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Salish">Coast Salish people</a> that occupied it before European settlement. I worked for the Canadian Federal Government as a civil servant for nearly a decade. I no longer self-identify as Canadian. I no longer vote</p>
    <p>I practice yoga and permaculture</p>
    <p>I've been in a hetero common-law relationship with my wife Chelsea for more than 17 years. My pronouns are he/him. We cohabitate and have two young children, a boy and a girl</p>
    <p>I long to see a world with more biodiversity and regenerative agriculture, less dependence on big governments and corporations, more local-scale resilience and community self-reliance through co-ops, fraternal organizations, charities, clubs, associations, societies and the like, more art, beauty, and play</p>
    <p>I'm a techno-optimist, a solar punk, but not the communist variety</p>
    <p>I can play guitar, piano and the harmonica, kinda</p>
    <p>I like to ride my bike and go for long walks in the forest</p>
    <p>My PGP key and social accounts are linked at <a href="https://keybase.io/asoltys">keybase</a></p>
