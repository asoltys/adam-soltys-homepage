<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Thanks for visiting my homepage.  This site is fairly new and I'm still trying to decide what I want to use it for.  I had a blog running for a while but I've taken it down for the time being.  Please <a href="/contact" title="Contact Page">let me know</a> if you have any suggestions.</p>

<h2>What's New</h2>

	Things are starting to get a bit hectic at work.  We have more than we can handle right now and there's a lot more coming soon.  It's all good though, I'm happy to be busy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Outside of work I've been teaching myself Spanish from an audio book that I took out from the library.  It's going well. I think as long as I continue to practice a little bit every day then by the time July rolls around I'll be able to handle myself just fine in Guatemala.
	</p>

	I signed up for tennis lessons recently and was supposed to have my first one yesterday but we got rained out so it will be tomorrow instead if the weather cooperates.  I'm hoping to finally be able to compete with Chelsea by the time I finish in June.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As far as movies go I've been on a bit of a Jack Nicholson kick lately.  I watched <em>Five Easy Pieces</em> and <em>The Passenger</em>.  Both were good but if I had to recommend just one it would be <em>Five Easy Pieces</em>.

	For the last three days I've been in Vancouver catching up with my team at work and visiting with friends and family.  I spent most of today in transit but when I finally got home I played some tennis with Chelsea and we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/" title="IMDB">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a> which I thought was pretty funny.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My travel plans are really starting to solidify now.  It's looking like I'll be going to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzaltenango" title="Wikipedia Entry for Quetzaltenango">Quetzaltenango, Guatemala</a> with Chelsea from about July 7 to July 27 and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Vallarta" title="Wikipedia Entry for Puerto Vallarta">Puerto Vallarta, Mexico</a> with mom from October 20 to November 6.  I'm also hoping to attend the <a href="http://sasquatchfestival.com/2008/" title="Sasquatch Festival Homepage">Sasquatch Music Festival</a> over May long weekend.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In the past couple of weeks I've been geeking out quite a bit.  I purchased a used computer and put <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu Homepage">Ubuntu Linux</a> on it and have been experimenting with some different technologies: <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/" title="Thin Web Server">thin</a> (a mongrel alternative), <a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main" title="Nginx Web Server">nginx</a> (an apache alternative), <a href="http://merbivore.com/" title="Merb Framework">merb</a> (a rails alternative), <a href="http://git.or.cz/" title="Git Version Control System">git</a> (a subversion alternative).

	I've been reading about investing and personal finance quite a bit lately and have recently made my first stock purchases.  I've created a <%= link_to 'Finances Page', finances_path, :title => 'Finances Page' %> on this site where I'll be posting my stocks and keeping track of their performance.  I've also made a few other changes like adding in some generic images to liven up the pages a bit and creating this <strong>What's New</strong> section that you're reading right now.

		As far as work and life goes, well, I picked up my class 6 learner's license this week so I'm now authorized to ride a motorcycle under the supervision of a more experienced rider.  Also I've been slowly (very slowly!) working my way through the original Spanish version of <em>Love in the Time of Cholera</em> by Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez in the hopes of picking up some Spanish.  Mom and I have been talking about doing some sort of trip to Central or South America next fall so being able to speak the language should come in handy.
