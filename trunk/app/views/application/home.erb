<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Thanks for visiting my homepage.  This site officially went 'live' on January 8, 2008.  I'm sure a few things are still a bit rough around the edges though so please <a href="/contact">let me know</a> if you have any suggestions.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>I'm 24 years old and recently graduated from the <a href="http://ww.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a> with a degree in computer science.  Right now I'm working for <a href="http://pwgsc.gc.ca/">Public Works and Government Services Canada</a> which is an arm of the Canadian federal government.  I live in a little one-bedroom basement suite in Victoria, British Columbia, with my girlfriend Chelsea who is in her second year of the <a href="http://www.med.ubc.ca/faculty_staff/deansoffice/Island_Medical_Program.htm">Island Medical Program</a>.  Most of our friends and family live in Vancouver on the other side of the water from us so we visit there fairly often.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>At work I make web applications with Adobe <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/">ColdFusion</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a>.  I occasionally do some contract work on the side for local entrepreneurs and my brother-in-law Geoff who lives in Australia.  I like taking on little side projects because they let me dabble with technologies like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> that I wouldn't otherwise be exposed to at my day job.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>Reading Wikipedia articles and surfing the Internet is my favourite pastime.  When I'm online I tend to go by the nickname asoltys.  I also like to read books and watch a lot of movies.  I lead a fairly active lifestyle though, despite my nerdy job and interests, mainly because Chelsea and my friends are very energetic and outgoing people.</p>

<p>This winter I've been swimming, snowboarding, indoor rockclimbing, ballroom dancing, and have been running and going to the gym.  I also ride my bike pretty much everywhere I go.  In the summers I like to go hiking and camping, play tennis, swim, travel, and lounge out on the beach.  This summer I'd like to take up sailing and get my motorcycle license so I can do a road trip to South America.</p>

<p>My taste in music is pretty standard. I like that old time rock n' roll but I enjoy just about anything depending on my mood.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>I'm an optimist.  The more I learn and discover what's already been accomplished, the more I appreciate the magnitude of human achievement and potential.  My interests cover pretty much the entire spectrum of human experience.  You'd be pretty hard-pressed to name a subject that I would say is boring.</p>

<p>I have a lot of respect for nature and so I try to lead a relatively simple lifestyle.  I do however look to technology as the key to expanding our natural capacity for knowledge and improving the way we share information.</p>
