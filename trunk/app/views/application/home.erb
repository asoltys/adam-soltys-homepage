<h2>About Me</h2>

<img id="photo" src="/images/adam_soltys.jpg" title="Adam Soltys" alt="Adam Soltys" />

<p>I'm 24 years old and recently graduated from the <a href="http://ww.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a> with a degree in computer science.  Right now I'm working for <a href="http://pwgsc.gc.ca/">Public Works and Government Services Canada</a> which is an arm of the Canadian federal government.  I live in a little one-bedroom basement suite in Victoria, British Columbia, with my girlfriend Chelsea who is in her second year of the <a href="http://www.med.ubc.ca/faculty_staff/deansoffice/Island_Medical_Program.htm">Island Medical Program</a>.  Most of our friends and family live in Vancouver on the other side of the water from us so we visit there fairly often.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>At work I make web applications with Adobe <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/">ColdFusion</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a>.  I occasionally do some contract work on the side for local entrepreneurs and my brother-in-law Geoff who lives in Australia.  I like taking on little side projects because they let me dabble with technologies like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> that I wouldn't otherwise be exposed to at my day job.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>I spend a lot of time surfing the Internet reading blogs, articles, and Wikipedia.  I also like to read books and watch movies.  I lead a fairly active lifestyle though, despite my nerdy job and interests.</p>

<p>This winter I've been swimming, snowboarding, rockclimbing, dancing, running and going to the gym.  I also ride my bike pretty much everywhere I go.  In the summers I like to go hiking and camping, play tennis, swim, travel, and lounge out on the beach.  This summer I'd like to take up sailing and get my motorcycle license so I can do a road trip to South America.</p>

<p>My taste in music is pretty standard. I like that old time rock n' roll but I'll enjoy just about anything depending on my mood.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>I'm an optimist.  The more I learn and discover what's already been accomplished, the more I appreciate the magnitude of human achievement and potential.  My interests cover pretty much the entire spectrum of human experience.  You'd be pretty hard-pressed to name a subject that I would say is boring.</p>

<p>I have a lot of respect for nature and I try to lead a relatively simple lifestyle.  I look to technology however as the key to expanding our capacity for knowledge and improving our quality of life.</p>
